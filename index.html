            <h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h2>
                <p>Today's Highlights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Made a crystal model in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)">Blender.</a> (Picture below)</li>
                    <li>Saw a hummingbird out my window.</li>
                    <li>Ate chicken for dinner. </li>
                </ul>

                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dxRSXek.png" alt="crystal" width="400"/>

                <p>Today's low-lights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Paid credit card.</li>
                    <li>Stubbed toe on doorframe.</li>
                    <li>Burned my toast in the morning.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Today I had my lab for <span class="course">CSE 110</span>, some homework for <span class="course">EDS 124</span> and some homework for <span class="course">CSE 101</span> so a pretty normal day overall.
                Also, I had to check the <strong>Covid Vaccine Schedule</strong>, which is of very great importance. 
                I also went to the grocery store at <b class="place">1234 Fake Street</b> but the grocery store address isn't that
                important to know. In addition, I <em>swear</em> that I saw someone at the store with a pet lizard on their 
                shoulder which was pretty unexpected. To end the day I read one of my favorite books <i>Nightmares and 
                    Dreamscapes</i> by Stephen King. </p>

                <p>I also wrote a haiku to summarize today:</p>
                <p> Woke up kind of late<br>
                    Did all that I had to<br>
                    Ate chicken dinner<br>
                </p>





            <h2 id="thursday">Thursday</h2>
            <p>
              Today was pretty cool, I practiced some more with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)">Blender.</a>
              I made a few models to practice basic bone-rigging and animation (Videos below). I still need to practice using
              IK-bones to automate some of the movements, but for now it was fun just to fiddle around with the model rigs.

                The left video is supposed to be the "Praise the Sun" gesture from the game <i>Dark Souls.</i> The right is just
                a little blob doing a dance.

            <h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>
                <p>
                   Today was also a pretty good day, I listened to this song which is kind of catchy I think. Our team also had our
                   first meeting today, we played Jackbox which was alot of fun. We also decided our team name would be the <i>
                       Cool Beans</i>.
